We have tried to take the original analysis further to analyze vaccine hesitancy in multi-party governed countries like India.

Hypothesis 1: In multi-party governed countries, states with the same ruling party as the central will have higher vaccinated population.
Hypothesis 2: People in rural regions are more hesitant towards taking the vaccine.
